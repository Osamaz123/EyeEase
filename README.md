# EyeEase

## Overview

EyeEase is a simple yet effective tool designed to help you follow the 20-20-20 rule for eye relaxation. This tool reminds you to take a 20-second break every 20 minutes and look at something 20 feet away, which helps in reducing eye strain and maintaining healthy vision.

## The 20-20-20 Rule

The 20-20-20 rule is a simple guideline to help reduce digital eye strain. It suggests that for every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, a person should take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away. This practice helps relax the eye muscles, reduce fatigue, and prevent discomfort associated with prolonged screen time.

### Benefits of the 20-20-20 Rule

- **Reduces Eye Strain**: Regular breaks can help alleviate eye strain and prevent long-term vision problems.
- **Prevents Dry Eyes**: Looking away from the screen and blinking more often can help keep your eyes moist.
- **Improves Focus**: Taking short breaks can help maintain your overall productivity and focus.

- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Sound alert for break notifications.
